# beginnersWebsite
Beginner's website for a fake company
So far I have three files: html, or the index.html, style.css, and sketch.js that are my main works for the site.
I'm hoping any great teachers out there find this and can maybe help me out with some constructive critisism, or help teach me more.
Also hoping to find other beginners out there too, since maybe we can work together. 
Also, if anyone could help me navigate github better, that'd be great since I'm not sure I'm doing this correctly at all.

As for the code, it is all pretty simple right now. I only have work done on the main home page of the website. 
I have four animated circles created with p5.js in the javascript file. 
Inside the circles I have 3 headers, and those are header, header2, and header3 classes in my css file. 
I also have one paragraph, and two ul's. In css, those are classes para, list, and listLocations.
