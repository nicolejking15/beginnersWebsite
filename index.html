    <h1 class="header">About</h1>
    <p class="para">Nannies-R-Us is a Nevada based childcare service dedicated to providing top tier nannies. Our nannies are all child development graduates with CPR certification, extensive emergency training, FBI level background checks, and vetted every six months for your added protection. Our company did seven years of research before opening to ensure our vetting and training processes were perfected. Your child's safety and protection are our number one priority, and we make sure to uphold our values at every step of the way. We strive to make you and your children feel safe, protected, and well nurtured by offering healthy choice meal preperation, two hour study and homework sessions, fun outdoor exercise for play time, and specialty hobby training such as piano, writing, dance, and karate. To keep your costs down, we frequently run massive fundraisers, bakesales, and host large parent/child play parties in order to generate as much of the needed assets from external sources as possible. Feel free, to check our upcoming events page to come support us.</p>
